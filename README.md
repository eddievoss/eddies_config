# Eddie's Development Environment

A collection of my personal configuration files, scripts, and resources for a **privacy-focused**, **ergonomic**, and **efficient** development workflow.

---

## 🛡️ Philosophy & Workflow

- **Keyboard Centric** – Vim/Neovim keybindings everywhere for efficiency and reduced mouse use.
- **Privacy Oriented** – Minimal telemetry, hardened browser configurations, and trusted open-source tools.  
- **Ergonomic** – **Colemak-DH** on an **ortholinear split keyboard** to minimize strain. Years of alpine climbing and splitboarding have left me with wrist injuries, so longevity is a top priority.  
- **Platform Consistency** – I split time between **Pop!\_OS** at home and **Windows** at work, keeping my tools and workflow mostly uniform across environments.
